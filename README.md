# webpack-config-typescript

> A Webpack 3 extender to include typescript configuration.

This project was born of using TS on Lambda functions without copy-pasting a giant webpack configuration around. It is still in early stages of development.

It will copy a very opinionated `tsconfig.json` and `tslint.json` into your project in order for you to customize to your liking. I'd rather have a generated of each than extending a base one.
